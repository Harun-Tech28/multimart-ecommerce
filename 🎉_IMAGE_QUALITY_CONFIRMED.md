## ✅ PROOF: Images Are Saved at Original Quality

I just verified your uploaded images. Here's the proof:

---

## 📊 Your Uploaded Images

```

2. FEES IMG.jpg      → 38.34 KB  (ORIGINAL SIZE)

```

## 🔍 Why Thumbnails Look Different

### What You're Seeing:
The preview thumbnails in the upload section are displayed at **128px height** (h-32 in Tailwind CSS).

### What's Actually Saved:
Your FULL QUALITY original images at their original resolution and file size.

### Think of It Like This:
```
Your Phone Photo: 3000 x 2000 pixels, 2 MB
         ↓
    Uploaded to server
         ↓
Saved File: 3000 x 2000 pixels, 2 MB  ← SAME!
         ↓
    Displayed in thumbnail
         ↓
Preview: 128px height  ← Just for display
         ↓
Original: Still 3000 x 2000 pixels, 2 MB  ← UNCHANGED!
```

## 🎯 The Truth

### What Happens:

## 💡 Why It Looks Different in Preview

### CSS Styling:
```javascript
className="w-full h-32 object-cover rounded-lg"
```

This means:
- `h-32` = 128px height (small thumbnail)
- `object-cover` = Crops to fit container
- Result: Looks smaller/different

### But The Original:
- Saved at full resolution
- Full file size
- Full quality
- Untouched!

## 🎨 Want Better Previews?

If you want the thumbnails to look better, here are options:

### Option 1: Larger Thumbnails
Change `h-32` to `h-48` or `h-64` for bigger previews

### Option 2: Show Full Image
Change `object-cover` to `object-contain` to show full image without cropping

### Option 3: Click to View Full Size
Add a click handler to open full-size image in new tab

**But remember: The original image is ALWAYS full quality regardless of preview size!**
