### For Developers

```javascript

const formData = new FormData();
files.forEach(file => formData.append('files', file));

const response = await fetch('/api/upload/product', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` },
  body: formData
});

// Delete file
await fetch('/api/upload/product', {
  method: 'DELETE',

    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ filePath: '/uploads/products/file.jpg' })
});
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Change Upload Limits

Edit `backend/src/config/upload.js`:

```javascript
limits: {
  fileSize: 50 * 1024 * 1024 // Change this (in bytes)
}
```

### Change Max Files

Edit `backend/src/routes/uploadRoutes.js`:

```javascript
upload.array('files', 10) // Change the number
```

### Add File Types

Edit `backend/src/config/upload.js`:

```javascript
const imageTypes = /jpeg|jpg|png|gif|webp|svg/; // Add types
const videoTypes = /mp4|avi|mov|wmv|webm|mkv/; // Add types
```

## 🚨 Known Issues

1. **ESLint Warning**: Minor warning about useEffect dependency (non-blocking)
2. **Local Storage**: Files stored locally (not suitable for production scale)
3. **No Image Processing**: Images uploaded as-is without optimization

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Short Term
- [ ] Add image compression
- [ ] Implement image cropping
- [ ] Add progress bar for uploads
- [ ] Support image reordering

### Long Term
- [ ] Cloud storage integration (AWS S3, Cloudinary)
