# ✅ Admin Dashboard Blank Pages - Complete Fix

## Summary

Successfully fixed all blank pages in the admin dashboard. The issue was that some pages were missing backend API endpoints, and one page (Orders) was completely missing.

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Missing Backend API Endpoints

**Pages Affected**: Dashboard, Users, Vendors, Products, Categories

**Issue**: Frontend pages were calling API endpoints that didn't exist or were incomplete.

**Solution**: Added complete backend implementation for all admin endpoints.

### 2. Missing Orders Page

**Page Affected**: Orders

**Issue**: Admin sidebar had "Orders" menu item, but the page component and routes didn't exist.

**Solution**: Created complete AdminOrders page with full functionality.
