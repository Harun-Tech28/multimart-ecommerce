## 📝 WHAT'S LEFT TO DO

### Step 1: Get MongoDB Connection String (5 min)
You have the MongoDB Atlas account. You need to:
1. Create a cluster (if not done)
2. Create database user
3. Configure network access (add `0.0.0.0/0`)
4. Get connection string

**Your connection string format:**
```
mongodb+srv://harunadramani5_db_user:YOUR_PASSWORD@cluster0.gxblr43.mongodb.net/multimart?appName=Cluster0
```

**Guide:** `GET_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING.md`

### Step 2: Deploy Backend to Vercel (4 min)
```bash
cd backend
vercel --prod
```
Then add environment variables in Vercel dashboard.

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend to Vercel (3 min)
```bash
cd frontend
vercel --prod
```
Then add environment variables in Vercel dashboard.

### Step 4: Connect Everything (1 min)
Update backend `CLIENT_URL` and redeploy.
