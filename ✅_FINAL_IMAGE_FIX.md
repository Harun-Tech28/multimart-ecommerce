## 🎯 Why "No Image" Appears

### The Cache Problem:
```
1. First visit → Image URL doesn't exist yet → Browser caches "404"
2. Upload image → Image now exists
3. Visit again → Browser uses cached "404" → Shows "No Image"
4. Hard refresh → Browser requests fresh → Shows actual image!
```

## ✅ Complete Solution

### Option 1: Clear Cache (Recommended)
```
1. Ctrl + Shift + Delete
2. Clear all data
3. Ctrl + Shift + R
4. Images will load!
```

### Option 2: Disable Cache (For Development)
```
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Check "Disable cache"
4. Keep DevTools open while developing
```

### Option 3: Incognito Mode
```
1. Ctrl + Shift + N (new incognito window)
2. Go to http://localhost:3000
3. Images will load fresh!
```

## 🔍 Verify It's Working

### Test 1: Direct Image URL
```
http://localhost:8000/uploads/products/selfie-1761690989182-202108686.jpg
```
✅ Should show the image

### Test 2: Product Details Page
```
http://localhost:3000/products/YOUR-PRODUCT-ID
```
✅ Should show product image

### Test 3: Products List
```
http://localhost:3000/products
```

## 💡 For Future Uploads

### After Uploading New Images:
1. **Always hard refresh** - Ctrl + Shift + R
2. **Or use incognito mode** for testing
3. **Or disable cache** in DevTools

### Why This Happens:
- Browser caches images for performance
- When URL changes (new upload), cache is stale
- Hard refresh forces fresh load
