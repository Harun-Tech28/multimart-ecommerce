```

## Important Notes

- Admin accounts have full platform access

### Permissions

- ‚úÖ Approve/reject vendors
- ‚úÖ Suspend user accounts
- ‚úÖ Manage categories
- ‚úÖ Delete products
- ‚úÖ View platform analytics

### Backend Requirements

Make sure your backend supports admin registration:

1. **User Model** should have a `role` field that accepts:
   - `customer`
   - `vendor`
   - `admin`

2. **Registration Endpoint** (`POST /api/auth/register`) should accept:
```json
{
  "firstName": "Admin",
  "lastName": "User",
  "email": "admin@multimart.com",
  "password": "Admin123!",
  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "role": "admin"
}
```

3. **Authentication Middleware** should check user roles for admin routes

## Troubleshooting

### Can't See Admin Dashboard Link
- Make sure you registered with role "admin"
- Check localStorage: `localStorage.getItem('user')` should show `"role": "admin"`
- Try logging out and logging back in

### Access Denied to Admin Pages
- Verify your account role is set to "admin" in the database
- Check if the backend is validating admin permissions correctly
- Look for errors in the browser console (F12)

### Backend Not Running
If you get connection errors:
1. Make sure backend is running on port 8000
2. Check MongoDB is connected
3. Verify API endpoints are working

## Alternative: Direct Database Method

If you prefer, you can also create an admin user directly in MongoDB:

```javascript
// Using MongoDB Compass or mongo shell
db.users.insertOne({
  firstName: "Admin",
  lastName: "User",
  email: "admin@multimart.com",
  password: "$2a$10$hashedPasswordHere", // Use bcrypt to hash
  role: "admin",
  phone: "+1234567890",
  createdAt: new Date(),
  updatedAt: new Date()
})
```

Or update an existing user:

```javascript
db.users.updateOne(
  { email: "your-email@example.com" },
  { $set: { role: "admin" } }
)
```

## Next Steps

After registering as admin:

1. **Explore the Dashboard**
   - Check platform statistics
   - View recent activity

2. **Manage Users**
   - Browse registered users
   - Test suspend/activate features

3. **Manage Vendors**

   - Monitor vendor stores

4. **Manage Categories**
