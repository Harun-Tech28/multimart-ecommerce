**Root Cause**: Frontend was trying to connect to `localhost:8000` but backend was running on `localhost:5000`

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### 1. Backend Port Configuration
- Changed backend port from 8000 to 5000
- Updated `backend/.env` file
- Restarted backend on correct port

### 2. Frontend API URLs
- Fixed **75 hardcoded URLs** across 33 files
- Changed all `localhost:8000` to `localhost:5000`

  - Components (WishlistButton, NotificationBell, etc.)
  - Services (api.js)
  - Utils (imageHelper.js)
  - Admin pages
  - Vendor pages

### 3. Restarted Services

- Create a new account
- Should work properly

### 3. Products
- Browse products
- Add to cart
- Should load correctly

## üîß What Caused This

### Timeline:
1. Backend was originally on port 8000
2. Changed to port 5000 for consistency
3. Frontend files still had hardcoded port 8000
4. All API calls were failing
5. "Network error" appeared on login

### Why It Happened:
- Hardcoded URLs instead of using environment variables
- Port change wasn't propagated to all files
- No centralized API configuration

---

## üí° Prevention for Future

### Best Practice:
Always use environment variables for API URLs:

**In `.env` or `.env.local`:**
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

**In code:**
```javascript
const API_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://localhost:5000';
```

### Already Implemented:
- `frontend/src/config/api.js` uses environment variables
- `frontend/src/services/api.js` uses environment variables
- Some files were still using hardcoded URLs (now fixed)

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

- [x] Backend running on port 5000
- [x] Frontend running on port 3000
- [x] All API URLs updated to port 5000
- [x] MongoDB connected
- [x] Login page loads
- [x] No "Network error" message
- [x] Changes committed to GitHub
