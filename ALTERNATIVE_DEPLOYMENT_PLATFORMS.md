## 🎯 Best Choice for Your Project

**For MultiMart E-Commerce:**

### Option 1: Render (Recommended)
- Deploy both frontend and backend
- Free forever
- Easy setup
- Good performance

### Option 2: Netlify + Railway
- Netlify for frontend (faster)
- Railway for backend
- $5/month for backend
- Best performance

### Option 3: Keep Vercel (Fix the issue)
- Your deployment is actually working
- Just needs environment variables
- Already set up
- Just add the 5 variables

---

## 💡 My Honest Recommendation

**Actually, your Vercel deployment is fine!** The 404 error is normal without environment variables. 

**Just add the 5 environment variables and it will work perfectly.**

But if you really want to switch, **Render** is the best alternative.

## 🆘 Which Should You Choose?

**Stay with Vercel if**:
- You just need to add environment variables
- You want the fastest deployment
- You're okay with serverless

**Switch to Render if**:
- You want traditional server hosting
- You prefer simpler environment setup
- You want everything in one place

**Want me to help you deploy to Render instead? Or should we fix the Vercel deployment (it's actually very close to working)?**
