## If You See an Error Page

### Check These:

1. **URL is correct**
   - Make sure you're accessing a valid route
   - Check for typos in the URL

2. **Servers are running**
   ```bash
   # Backend should show:
   🚀 Server running in development mode on port 8000
   ✅ MongoDB Connected: localhost
   
   # Frontend should show:
   webpack compiled with warnings (or successfully)
   ```

3. **Browser console**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Check Console tab for errors
   - Check Network tab for failed requests

4. **Clear browser cache**
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Or clear cache in browser settings

5. **Check MongoDB**
   - Make sure MongoDB is running
   - Check connection in backend logs

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot GET /some-route"

**Solution**: The route doesn't exist. Check App.js for available routes.

### Issue: Blank page

**Solution**: 
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify backend API is responding
- Check if you're logged in (for protected routes)

### Issue: 404 errors

**Solution**:
- Backend might not be running
- Check API endpoint URLs
- Verify route exists in backend

### Issue: Authentication errors

**Solution**:
- Clear localStorage
- Login again
- Check token validity

## Quick Restart

If you encounter any issues, restart both servers:

```bash
# Stop both servers (Ctrl+C in each terminal)

# Restart backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Restart frontend (in new terminal)
cd frontend
npm start
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Backend Health Check**
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/health
   ```
   Should return: `{"success":true,"message":"MultiMart API is running",...}`

2. **Frontend Loading**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
   Should show the home page

3. **Admin Dashboard**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/admin/dashboard
   ```
   Should show admin dashboard (after login)
