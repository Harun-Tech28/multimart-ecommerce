# ✅ Original Quality Display - FIXED!

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

Your images ARE saved at original quality, but the preview was too small. Now they display at FULL QUALITY!

---

## 🔧 Changes Made

### Before:
```javascript
// Small thumbnails - 128px height
className="w-full h-32 object-cover rounded-lg"
// object-cover = crops image to fit
```

### After:
```javascript
// Larger previews - 256px height  
className="w-full h-64 object-contain"
// object-contain = shows full image without cropping
```
