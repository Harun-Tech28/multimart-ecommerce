## Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå "Access denied. Admin credentials required."
**Solution**: Your account role is not set to "admin"
- Check registration: Did you select "Admin" in Account Type?
- Check database: Verify `role` field is `"admin"` in users collection
- Try Method 2 to update existing user

### ‚ùå "Invalid credentials"
**Solution**: Email or password is incorrect
- Double-check email and password
- Passwords are case-sensitive
- Make sure you registered the account first

### ‚ùå Can't access admin pages after login
**Solution**: Role verification issue
- Open browser console (F12)
- Check localStorage: `localStorage.getItem('user')`
- Should show `"role": "admin"`
- If not, logout and login again

### ‚ùå Backend connection error
**Solution**: Backend server not running
- Start backend: `cd backend && npm start`
- Check MongoDB is running
- Verify backend is on port 8000
