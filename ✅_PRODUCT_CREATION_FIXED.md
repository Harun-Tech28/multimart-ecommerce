# ✅ Product Creation Error FIXED!

The "Error saving product" issue has been resolved!

---

## 🐛 What Was Wrong

**Problem:** When clicking "Create Product", you got an error: "Error saving product"

**Root Cause:** 
- Frontend was calling: `/api/vendor/products` (singular)
- Backend routes were mounted at: `/api/vendors/products` (plural)
- Result: 404 Not Found error

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Backend Changes:
✅ **Added product routes to vendorRoutes.js**
- Added POST `/api/vendors/products` - Create product
- Added GET `/api/vendors/products` - Get all vendor products
- Added GET `/api/vendors/products/:id` - Get single product
- Added PUT `/api/vendors/products/:id` - Update product
- Added DELETE `/api/vendors/products/:id` - Delete product

### Frontend Changes:
✅ **Updated API endpoints in 4 files:**
1. `VendorProductForm.jsx` - Create/Edit product form
2. `VendorProducts.jsx` - Products list page
3. `VendorDashboard.jsx` - Dashboard overview

Changed from: `/api/vendor/products` → `/api/vendors/products`

- `backend/src/routes/vendorRoutes.js` - Added product routes

### Frontend:
- `frontend/src/pages/vendor/VendorProductForm.jsx` - Fixed create/edit endpoints
