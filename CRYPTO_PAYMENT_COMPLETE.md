2. Set `PAYMENT_GATEWAY=crypto`
3. The system will generate mock payment data
4. You can test the entire flow
5. Payments will auto-verify in mock mode

### **Sandbox Mode (With Test API Keys):**

All providers offer sandbox/test environments:

**CoinGate Sandbox:**
```env
PAYMENT_GATEWAY=coingate
COINGATE_API_KEY=sandbox_key_here
```

**Coinbase Commerce Testnet:**
```env
PAYMENT_GATEWAY=coinbase
COINBASE_COMMERCE_API_KEY=test_key_here
