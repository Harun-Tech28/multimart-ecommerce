# üîß Fix Image Upload Issue

Your image upload functionality is already implemented! Let's troubleshoot why it's not working.

---

## ‚úÖ What's Already Set Up

Your system has:
- ‚úÖ Upload controller configured
- ‚úÖ Multer middleware for file handling
- ‚úÖ Upload routes registered
- ‚úÖ Static file serving enabled
- ‚úÖ Frontend upload form ready

---

## üîç Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Backend Not Running

**Symptom:** Upload button doesn't work, no response

**Solution:**
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

Make sure you see:
```
üöÄ Server running in development mode on port 8000
‚úÖ MongoDB Connected
```

---

### Issue 2: Upload Directory Missing

**Symptom:** Error: "ENOENT: no such file or directory"

**Solution:** Run this script to create upload directories:

```bash
cd backend
node create-upload-dirs.js
```

---

### Issue 3: File Size Too Large

**Symptom:** Upload fails with "File too large" error

**Solution:** Your limit is 50MB. If you need larger files:

1. Edit `backend/src/config/upload.js`
2. Change line:
   ```javascript
   fileSize: 50 * 1024 * 1024 // 50MB
   ```
   To:
   ```javascript
   fileSize: 100 * 1024 * 1024 // 100MB
   ```

---

### Issue 4: Wrong File Type

**Symptom:** "Only image files are allowed" error

**Allowed file types:**
- Images: JPEG, JPG, PNG, GIF, WEBP
- Videos: MP4, AVI, MOV, WMV, WEBM

**Solution:** Make sure your files are in these formats.

---

### Issue 5: Not Logged In as Vendor/Admin

**Symptom:** "Unauthorized" or "Access denied" error

**Solution:**
1. Login as vendor or admin
2. Email: `admin@multimart.com`
3. Password: `Admin123`

---

### Issue 6: CORS Error

**Symptom:** "CORS policy" error in browser console

**Solution:** Backend CORS is already configured for `http://localhost:3000`

If using different port, update `backend/.env`:
```
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:YOUR_PORT
```

---

## üß™ Test Upload Functionality

### Step 1: Check Upload Directory

```bash
cd backend
node check-upload-setup.js
```

This will:
- Check if upload directories exist
- Create them if missing
- Show current permissions

### Step 2: Test Upload API

```bash
cd backend
node test-upload.js
```

This will test the upload endpoint directly.
